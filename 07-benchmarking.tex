\subsection{Blockbook}
Blockbook\footnote{\url{https://github.com/trezor/blockbook}} is a blockchain indexer for Trezor Wallet\footnote{\url{https://wallet.trezor.io/}}, developed by SatoshiLabs\footnote{\url{https://satoshilabs.com/}}. It currently supports more than 30 coins (and the community implemented some others). For data storage Blockbook is using RocksDB\footnote{\url{https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki}} developed by Facebook, which is a NoSQL database that stores only key-value pairs. Blockbook is providing fast API for accessing blocks, addresses and transactions. Main limitations of blockbook:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Not distributed} (client-server architecture) - problem with scaling for more users. 
    \item \textbf{Not a SQL database} - it does not have a relational data model, it does not support SQL queries, and it has no support for indexes.
    \item \textbf{Single-Process} - only a single process (possibly multi-threaded) can access a particular database at a time.
\end{itemize}
